# Prime Minister for a day
## Overview
This project is a Java-based application that allows users to **view, analyze, and modify the state budget** as if they were the Prime Minister for a day.
It is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) program with optional graphical extensions. 
The goal is to give users control over public budget data, simulate fiscal decisions, and observe their effects.
## Core Features
- Display budget data in a structured format
- Add or modify income and expenditure entries
- Validate user inputs and enforce constraints
- Display a summary of all changes made during the session
## Optional Extensions
- Multi-level analysis of revenues and expenses
- Categorization and aggregation of budget data
- Scenario simulation (e.g., changing VAT rates)
- Multi-year operation and comparisons
- Save and load budget states
- Mass or horizontal policy changes
- Comparison of different budget scenarios
- Graphs and visualizations
- Graphical or web-based user interface
